## 🚀 About Me

- **The Evolution:** Transitioned from a Senior Data Analyst into a **Data Engineer**. I don't just interpret data; I build the robust pipelines and back-end systems that power it.
- **Domain Expertise:** Spent 6 years at the intersection of data and logic in the Travel Tech sector (Travelport), specializing in Flight Contract Analysis and Galileo GDS.
- **AI-Enhanced Engineering:** Currently sharpening my skills as an **AI Back-end Developer** at IDCamp 2025 to build intelligent, automated data processing systems.
- **Security-First Approach:** Intermediate-level Cybersecurity certified (Cisco), ensuring data integrity and threat management are baked into every system I build.
- **Recent Milestone:** Passed the National Competency Test (UJK) for Fullstack Development (Dec 2025), validating my ability to ship clean, maintainable, and industry-standard code.

## 🎯 What I Bring to the Table

1. **Analytical Precision:** 6 years of managing high-stakes airline contracts has ingrained a "zero-error" mindset. I approach data engineering with the surgical precision required to handle critical business logic.
2. **End-to-End System Perspective:** My background in Information Systems and Fullstack Development allows me to see the big picture—understanding how data originates in the UI and flows through the back-end into the database.
3. **Reliability-Focused:** I prioritize building stable, "behind-the-scenes" architectures. My goal is to create systems that are not just functional, but maintainable, secure, and resilient under scale.
