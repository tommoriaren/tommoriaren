## 🚀 About Me

### Strong Operational Data Foundation  
I spent over 5 years managing airline fare, pricing, and contract data within Travelport (Galileo GDS), where **precision, auditability, and zero-error tolerance** are mandatory.

### Structured Career Transition  
I transitioned from Data Operations into Data Analytics through **project-based learning**, hands-on analytics projects, and real-world operational data system implementation.

### Data First, Tools Second  
I focus on **how data flows, where errors occur, and how insights support decisions**, not just on tools or dashboards.
